        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>
        I am <b>Amit Kumar Singh</b>, an academician and researcher in the field of Computer Science and Engineering, with a strong interest in modern computer networks, programmable data planes, and intelligent network monitoring systems. My work primarily focuses on networking problems, especially in areas such as flow identification, in-band network telemetry, and performance analysis of next-generation networks.
        </p>

        <p>
        I actively explore emerging technologies including Software Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and 5G systems, and I enjoy building practical lab environments using virtualization platforms and Linux-based tools to support both research and teaching activities.
        </p>

        <p>
        As a teacher, I believe in learning by implementation. I regularly develop study material, lab demonstrations, and hands-on exercises to help students understand complex networking and system concepts in a simple and practical manner. My goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world deployment.
